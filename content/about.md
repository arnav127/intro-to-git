This is a simple directory of freshers at Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology, built with Hugo and hosted in a [Github repository](https://github.com/seshaljain/intro-to-git), created by [@seshaljain](https://github.com/seshaljain).

New people can be added by creating a new file `content/your-name.md` according to instructions given on the homepage.

It is a very rudimentary website, and a step towards Hacktoberfest '19.
